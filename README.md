# Overview

As an aspiring software developer, continuously exercising my
skills and using the language are central to my learning efforts.

This program is a classic rite of passage for all programmers, but
this time, with a twist. Instead of a basic single-line print
statement of the words, "Hello world," I chose to write the 
phrase using ascii art, using the letters as the basic building
for each corresponding letter written in the ascii art style.

My purpose in creating this program was to highlight the
importance of reviewing old lessons using newfound concepts and
knowledge. It also shows that even seemingly boring tasks can be
made fun!

# Development Environment


To make this software I used the Jet Brains "PyCharm" IDE as my
coding environment.

The programming language used in this project was Python.
